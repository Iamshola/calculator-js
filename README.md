# Calculator cretated using JavaScript 

### Demo of my calculator can be viewed [here](https://iamshola.github.io/calculator-js/)
During my time at General Assembly, I had to create a calculator using inbuilt methods such as prompt and alert. I decided to create a UI and improve the user experience. 

### Future Features
I would like to add in more advance calculations such as BMI and mortage calculations.
